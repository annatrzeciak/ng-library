# NgCarService

It is a project which I created during learning Angular 4.

1. Install packages:
```
npm install
```
2. Run the app:
```
ng serve -o
```
3.  Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`


To correct working you should clone and install ServerTo-ng-car-service repo

1. Instal packages
```
npm install
```
2. Run the server
```
npm start
```
